libthekogans_stream is designed to be used to write high performance,
asynchronous, networked applications. It abstracts all the details and
platform differences from pipes, named pipes (Windows only) and
sockets. Asynchronous IO is done using best in class facilities
available on each platform (Windows: IOCP, Linux: epoll, OS X:
kqueue). The hallmarks of libthekogans_stream are itâ€™s simplicity and
elegance (if I say so myself). Here is the entire libthekogans_stream
hierarchy:

    Stream
        Pipe
        NamedPipe
            ClientNamedPipe
            ServerNamedPipe
        Socket
            TCPSocket
            UDPSocket

libthekogans_stream has the following required dependencies:

libthekogans_util

Windows: Ws2_32.lib, Iphlpapi.lib.

OS X: framworks: CoreFoundation, SystemConfiguration.

libthekogans_stream has the following optional dependencies:

if -DTHEKOGANS_STREAM_HAVE_OPENSSL is specified, libthekogans_crypto,
openssl_ssl, openssl_crypto.
