libthekogans_stream is designed to be used to write high performance,
asynchronous, networked applications. It abstracts all the details and
platform differences from pipes, named pipes (Windows only) and
sockets. Asynchronous IO is done using best in class facilities
available on each platform (Windows: IOCP, Linux: epoll, OS X:
kqueue). The hallmarks of libthekogans_stream are it’s simplicity and
elegance (if I say so myself). Here is the entire libthekogans_stream
hierarchy:

    Stream
        Pipe
        NamedPipe
            ClientNamedPipe
            ServerNamedPipe
        Socket
            TCPSocket
                ClientTCPSocket
                ServerTCPSocket
                SecureTCPSocket
                    ClientSecureTCPSocket
                ServerSecureTCPSocket
            UDPSocket
                ClientUDPSocket
                ServerUDPSocket
                SecureUDPSocket*
                    ClientSecureUDPSocket*
                ServerSecureUDPSocket*

* In the design and implementation phase. These should be available in
  version 0.12.0.

One of the greatest strengths of libthekogans_stream is it’s use of
the memento pattern to persist stream open parameters to allow streams
to be reconstituted from rest.

libthekogans_stream has the following required dependencies:

libthekogans_util
Windows: Ws2_32.lib, Iphlpapi.lib.
OS X: framworks: CoreFoundation, SystemConfiguration.

libthekogans_stream has the following optional dependencies:

if -DTHEKOGANS_STREAM_HAVE_PUGIXML is specified, pugixml.
if -DTHEKOGANS_STREAM_HAVE_OPENSSL is specified, libthekogans_crypto,
openssl_ssl, openssl_crypto.
